# MyFlashcards Project

This is my assessment project for the React Native part of Udacity's React NanoDegree program. 

In this project, I have created a mobile application from scratch with React Native. I have utilized React Native components and React Navigation to manage the user interface, used Redux store for state management, Async Storage to store data on local device, and Permissions and Notifications to create local notifications.

The App allows users to study with the help of flashcards.

In the app users are able to:
 -	create decks of flashcards, 
 -	add flashcards to those decks, 
 -	take quizzes on those decks.

## To get started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `expo start`

## Platforms

With React Native you can create native apps for both Android and iOS using React.

While the app could run on both Android and iOS devices, it has been tested so far on:
 -  Android devices

## Expo

This project was built with [Expo](https://expo.io/).
